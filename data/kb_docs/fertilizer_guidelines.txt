General agronomy guidance (demo):
- Soil pH < 5.5: consider liming; pH > 8 may reduce micronutrient availability.
- Low Nitrogen (N): increase urea or organic manure; split application recommended.
- Low Phosphorus (P): consider DAP/SSP based on soil type; incorporate in soil.
- Low Potassium (K): consider MOP; apply as basal dose.
Always consult local KVK/agri officer for region-specific dosage.
